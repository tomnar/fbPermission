fbPermission
==========

What is it?
-----
A chrome extension that highlights the needed permissions of Facebook login pop-ups.

Problem
-----
More and more services use social logins, from which Facebook is the most used one. However since the last redesign is 
it not clear anymore which permissions are asked for when logging into a website. Some of the more than 100 permissions
are just shown in a long string and it is hard to see what the app really asks for. The reduced transparency sets
users at risk to accept permissions they otherwise would not have agreed on. This is where fbPermission helps. By
clearly highlighting the requested permissions it can be seen in a few seconds if the app asks for reasonable information.

Stats
-----
Here are some stats from one of the more recent studies about the impact of fb-login
- 92% report having left a website when theyâ€™ve forgotten their username or password [1](http://janrain.com/resources/industry-research/2013-consumer-research-value-of-social-login/)
- 87% of consumers are aware of social login, and more than half have tried it [1](http://janrain.com/resources/industry-research/2013-consumer-research-value-of-social-login/)
- Facebook login is the most used social login with 45% world wide.

Goals
-----
- transparency: Made it easy and intuitive to see requested permissions.
- understandable: Offer a tooltip to every requested permission.
- customizable: It needs to be able to be tailored for the person uying it:
- privacy: Don't send any data out to any 3rd parties.
